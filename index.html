<h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>


<div class="section-two">

    <img class="typog"src="typography/1x/type 1.png">
<div class= "typotext"> This is an axial typrographic system,
     which means elements such as texts
    are portrayed on an axis or a line,
     just as I have done so here.


</div>






    <img class="typog"src="typography/1x/type 2.png">
<div class="typotext2"> A radial typographic system is one that a central point with rays coming out of it creating a laser beam type effect.

</div>

    <img class="typog"src="typography/1x/type 3.png">
    <div class="typotext3"> A dilatational system is on where all elements expand from a point of focus to create a circular, or an arch style.

    </div>

    <img class="typog"src="typography/1x/type 4.png">
<div class="typotext4"> A random system typography with no rules or purpose when executing it.

</div>

    
    <img class="typog2"src="typography/1x/type 5.png">
    <div class="typotext5"> The grid systems tends to work when there are line seperating the content, it could be horizontal or vertical or a square.

    </div>

    <img class="typog2"src="typography/1x/type 6.png">
    <div class="typotext6">The modular typography system contains shapes, which give a bubble effect like the one shown here.

    </div>
    <img class="typog2"src="typography/1x/type 7.png">
    <div class="typotext7">The transitional typographic system is one where the elements can move freely in a swivle type of way, these are typically used in posters and design web pages.

    </div>
    <img class="typog2"src="typography/1x/type 8.png">
    <div class="typotext8">The bilateral typography system, is the most plain and boring system as, the content is usually set in the center of the screen, and does not really excite anyone when it's used.

    </div>

<div class="section3">
<h3>POSTER CONTENT</h3>


<img class="poster1" src="posters/my poster 1 bad.jpg">
<div class="posttext">The poster I have made is my first attempt, I have many flaws with this, as the information for the skate clinic, is all over the place and the viewer would be confused about what to look at, as this is my first attempt, I have made another 2, each better than the last. The cutout of the woman on the skateboard was produced in Photoshop, using the magic wand tool, this was then exported into Adobe Illustrator, to create a cool effect.  The random shapes are unfinished and unprofessional and the viewer would instantly be unpleased with the poster.
    </div>
    <img class="poster2" src="posters/poster 2 decent.png">
   <div class="posttext2">This is the 2nd poster I made, this was such a huge improvement, as the font and text are easy to read allowing the readers to know all the information required. Also, the black text with the white backdrop makes it pop out giving it a better poster feel than the first one. There are also more graphics such as the heading and instead of cutting out a woman skateboarding I decided to use the whole image, this is because the viewer can see explicitly that someone is skating at a skate park.

   </div>
<img class="poster3" src="posters/poster 3 best.png">
<div class="posttext3">This is the third and final poster, and in my opion the best as the colour contrast is really eye popping for the viewers. The hue at the top really petrudes the rainbow logo, thus making it clear to the viewer what exactly it is they're looking at.
