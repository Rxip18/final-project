<h2>WEEKLY WORKSHEETS</h2>


<div class="section-two">
    <div class="worktext"> Below I will be sharing the links to my git hub repositories for all of my worksheet HTML coding tutorials and will be explaining how these impacted me and how I learnt from the tutorials to make my very own website.

    <div class="worktext2">I had the impression that HTML and CSS were foreign languages when I first met them. I had no idea where to start.  Then I came across these amazing worksheets for HTML and CSS coding. They went above and above what I expected when they said they would help me build my own website from scratch.
    The first worksheet provided was a kind of gentle introduction to this enormously unfamiliar world. It helped me comprehend the structure of a web page by breaking down the fundamentals of HTML. I gained knowledge about the basic tags: .html., .head., and . body. . This served as my base. The image got clearer with each practice. I now know how to use .p. to construct paragraphs and .h1. to .h6. to generate headers. These basic components served as my first building bricks and established the foundation for all that came after.

    <div class="worktext3">Then I was tasked to import music and images. This technique was made simple to grasp by the worksheets. I learnt how to add pictures using the .img.Â element, resizing and aligning them precisely inside my article. I had a rush of satisfaction when I saw an image show up on my page. That .audio. tag was just as exciting. My website would become dynamic and engaging if I were to include music samples. My projects now have more depth thanks to this capability.
