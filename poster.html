   <div class="posttext2">This is my Carp design poster, which I created in Adobe InDesign. The poster incorporates various typographic systems. For instance, the text around the pumpkin symbolizes the dilatational system, which causes the words to warp in a bridge or arch. This draws the reader's attention to specific information, such as the date and time. The poster also includes bilateral typography, which provides essential information like the address and venue numbers clearly and straightforwardly. There is also a part of my poster that consists of the modular typographic system as the orange bubbles symbolize pumpkins, fitting the theme perfectly for the content I'm providing. I'm providing. I also offered the radial typographic system as I incorporated them as the bullet points coming off the pumpkin to create a fun way of showing the information.        

   </div>

<div class="posttext3">The colour choice of orange and blue makes sense as they work well together, and pumpkins are orange. This is soothing to the eye. The orange parts of the poster are well placed, causing the reader to automatically look around as there is information everywhere, encouraging them to take in all the information.
